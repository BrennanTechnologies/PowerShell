In the context of PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC), [DscProperty(Key)] is an attribute that marks a property as a key property in a DSC resource.

A key property is used to uniquely identify a resource instance. It's similar to a primary key in a database. The values of key properties must be unique for each instance of a resource.

For example, if you have a DSC resource for managing files, the file path could be a key property because it uniquely identifies each file.

In your code, [DscProperty(Key)] is marking the property that follows it as a key property.
